				I’m Jade, a software engineer based in California’s Central Valley. I graduated in 2022 from
				San Francisco State University with a B.S. in Computer Science where I studied full-stack
				web and mobile development as well as human-computer interaction. I enjoy experimenting with
				new technologies to find the best solution for projects and I am determined to continue
				learning and growing as an engineer. I am always open to new opportunities and connections.

				When I am not working on a project, I love to spend my time practicing piano, drawing, going
				on boba crawls, and playing video games.
