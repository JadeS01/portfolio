				I’m Jade, a web developer based in the heart of California’s Central Valley. I graduated in
				2022 from San Francisco State University with a B.S. in Computer Science where I studied
				full-stack web and mobile development as well as human-computer interaction. I enjoy
				experimenting with new technologies to find the best solution for projects. I am determined
				to continue learning and growing as a web developer. I am always open to new opportunities
				and connections.

				When I am not working on a project, I love to spend my time practicing piano, drawing, going
				on boba crawls, and playing video games. It’s no surprise that video games sparked my
				interest in software development!
