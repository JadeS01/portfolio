				I’m Jade, a web developer based in California’s Central Valley. I graduated in 2022 from San
				Francisco State University with a B.S. in Computer Science where I studied full-stack web
				and mobile development as well as human-computer interaction. I enjoy experimenting with new
				technologies to find the best solution for projects. I am determined to continue learning
				and growing as a web developer. I am always open to new opportunities and connections.

				When I am not working on a project, I love to spend my time practicing piano, drawing, going
				on boba crawls, and playing video games. It’s no surprise that video games sparked my
				interest in software development!
